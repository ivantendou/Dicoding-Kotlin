// 01 - Concurrency

/* 
  Concurrency is several processes that occur simultaneously in a system. 
  Concurrency is a natural phenomenon that commonly occurs. Just like in the real world, many activities are carried out at the same time. 
  Thus, when we want to develop a system to help with real activities, of course we have to care about concurrency.
